Professional Self-Assessment
As I complete my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, I’ve taken time to reflect on the technical skills, experiences, and challenges that shaped me into a confident and capable computer science professional. My portfolio represents both my growth and readiness to enter the workforce with a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, database systems, and security practices.
Collaboration
Throughout the program, collaboration was an essential component of success. I participated in peer reviews, discussed complex problems in group discussions, and adapted to multiple viewpoints in team-based projects. For example, in my software engineering courses, I worked with classmates to plan system designs, develop UML diagrams, and divide responsibilities for implementation. These experiences taught me how to effectively communicate, resolve merge conflicts in Git, and align personal contributions with shared project goals, skills I now apply confidently in team environments.
Communication
Technical communication has been central to nearly every course. I’ve learned to write clean, well-commented code, document projects thoroughly, and present ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. The code review video in this portfolio demonstrates how I walk through functionality and planned enhancements clearly and professionally—skills that will help me collaborate with stakeholders in real-world environments.
Algorithms and Data Structures
My experience with data structures and algorithmic thinking is showcased in my enhancement for the Algorithms and Data Structures category. In this artifact, I optimized search and sort operations and implemented custom data structures that improved program efficiency. This process deepened my understanding of time complexity, recursion, and algorithm trade-offs, which are now part of how I approach problem-solving.
Software Design and Engineering
In the Software Design and Engineering category, I focused on enhancing a Java-based application originally built in IT-145 and later expanded into CS-320. My work included reorganizing classes for better cohesion, improving exception handling, and applying object-oriented principles like inheritance and encapsulation. This experience taught me how to design maintainable, scalable, and readable code, while also preparing me for future work in team-based development using best practices like SOLID design principles.
Databases
For my database enhancement, I integrated a MySQL backend into the contact management system. I resolved driver errors, handled SQL exceptions, and connected front-end forms to real-time persistent storage. This task significantly improved my SQL skills and my ability to troubleshoot connectivity issues. It also demonstrated the real-world challenge of managing external dependencies like JDBC drivers, and how to securely manage database interactions to prevent issues like SQL injection.
Security Mindset
Security was emphasized in courses like CS-405: Secure Coding and CS-410: Reverse Software Engineering. I developed an appreciation for validating user inputs, using prepared statements, avoiding hardcoded credentials, and performing static code analysis. These skills helped me ensure that the artifacts in my portfolio are not only functional but also mindful of security best practices. I now approach every coding task with a mindset of anticipating vulnerabilities and designing resilient solutions.
How My Artifacts Fit Together
Each artifact in this portfolio highlights a different facet of my learning:
•	Software Design & Engineering demonstrates my understanding of program architecture and object-oriented design.
•	Algorithms & Data Structures shows my problem-solving skills and efficiency improvements.
•	Databases reflects my ability to create robust, secure, and persistent data systems.
Together, these enhancements tell a cohesive story of my technical growth, project experience, and readiness to contribute to professional software development teams.
Final Thoughts
Developing this portfolio gave me a renewed appreciation for how far I’ve come, from writing basic loops and conditionals, to integrating full-stack applications with attention to performance, security, and user experience. I am excited to bring this knowledge and determination into the field and contribute meaningfully to any organization I join.
